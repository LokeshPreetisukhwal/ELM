ELM
a) App should have a list of employees of an organisation. Employees
information will be downloaded as a JSON file from any cloud link
(Google drive, Dropbox etc). This list will show name and photo of each
employee. Download operation should be done so that it can be
switched in between different ways of network communication in
android.
